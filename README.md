Plugin Name: WP Referrer Modal

Plugin URI:  https://github.com/sterndata/wp-referrer-modal

Description: warn about follow homes from wordpress.org

Tests to see if the access is coming from a link on WordPress.org and, if so, fires a modal dialog showing the text in the main plugin file.

Version 2 uses wp_editor instead of a text area and makes changes to the default CSS for the modal.
